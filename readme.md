### In this we will:

2. Create a thread
3. Create a message & add to thread
4. Run the assistant
5. Monitor the run status
6. Retrieve the messages from the thread

<!-- add instructions -->
### Setup

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.

In your project directory run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

In order to use this, please first get your own OpenAI API Key.

Once you have gotten your API key, create a .evn file and place it in there just like in the **.env-example** file.

*Make sure you replace the asst_id with your Assistant's ID*

Change out the user message to ask the assistant questions your assistant is prepared to answer.
